# Modules for the Bluescape App

These are node modules the Demos App uses to create a new Canvas and upload assets to it (from local drive or by URL), resizing the Canvas if more space is needed to accommodate the assets we are uploading.

## You can use this modules in your own apps

These modules can be used independently of this Demo App. You can re-use them to implement your own applications. See the description of each module, and then the documentation in each module, to see how to use them.

## Requirements

If you are going to use these modules independently of the Demo App, remember to install the libraries the modules need. 
Run `npm install` to install all the needed libraries.
